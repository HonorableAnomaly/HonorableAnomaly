- 👋 Hey there, I’m Ricky!
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... dying to self, sacrificially serving others in love and honoring the Lord with my thoughts, words and actions.
- My top hobbies involve playing the drums and working with music (including mixing), writing novels, creating art with various mediums and gaming.
-      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... handling errors in Express apps and validating data.
- 
- Creative Projects I'm working on - I have a few dynamic fan web projects I'm slowly working on that I'm pretty excited about. More to come!
- 1) Pokémon collecting and journaling
- 2) Warcraft lore explorer database
- 3) Fantasy author updates and news
-      
- 💞️ I’m collaborating on ... a conversationally savvy C-3P0 chatbot with a group of close developers. He's not the most exciting droid yet, but he's coming along.
